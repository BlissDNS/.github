# BlissDNS <br>
## Ad-Free, Encrypted, and Private DNS service. <br>
### What do we do? <br>
We are a public DNS service, free to use, that blocks ads, trackers, malware, and other nasy stuff that slows down or clutters your internet browsing experience. <br>
### How do I use BlissDNS? <br>
Easy, we have support for encrypted DNS with DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, and DNS-over-QUIC. We of course support sending traffic directly to our IP so you can set your router or any device to use us for DNS if it does not support using encryption directly. <br><br>
We also support Android's Private DNS feature with the same URL below! <br>
DoH/DoT/DoQ domain: us1.blissdns.net <br><br>
If you use Ad Guard Home and want to use us as your upstream DNS servers, you can do so with the following as your upstream DNS! <br><br>
tls://us1.blissdns.net <br>
https://us1.blissdns.net/dns-query <br>
quic://us1.blissdns.net <br><br>
If you are not using a service or device that takes advantage of encrypted DNS, you can send DNS queries our way at the following IP <br>
173.255.201.254 <br>
